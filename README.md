# Project: Write a Data Science Blog Post

## Installation
The code in the project was created using Python on the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html).

Please [install Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) before [running the project](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html)


## Project Motivation
This was the first project in my Data Science course and is a requirement for completion.

Having live near Seattle and with interest in Airbnb as a platform, I decided to analyze [Seattle Airbnb data](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data) for this project. 

The project analyzes the Seattle Airbnb data from the view of Airbnb users (host and guests). The focus was on the different factors that impact pricing. The intent was to use a data-driven approach to analyze how / why such factors impacted pricing.

The findings of the analysis are publish in the blog post: [insert here]

The approach for the analysis can be found on the Jupyter notebook: [insert here]
